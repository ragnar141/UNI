    "Description": "Ennius, born in Rudiae in southern Italy, was Rome’s first great national poet. A soldier turned writer, he claimed to have “three hearts” — Oscan, Greek, and Latin — reflecting his multilingual heritage. His monumental Annales narrated Rome’s history in epic verse and earned him the title “father of Roman poetry.” Though his works survive only in fragments, later Romans revered him as Homer reborn, a cultural bridge who carried Greek forms into Latin and gave Rome a literary identity equal to Greece.",
