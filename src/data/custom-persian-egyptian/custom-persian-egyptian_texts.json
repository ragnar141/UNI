    "Short Description": "A poetic and mythic reflection on the ruin of a sacred Egyptian sanctuary, portraying the desecration of temples, the silence of gods, and the collapse of divine order (ma’at). The text adopts a mournful, symbolic tone without explicitly naming the invaders, but its imagery strongly evokes historical traumas likely tied to the Persian conquests of Egypt—particularly the sackings under Cambyses II (525 BCE), which saw widespread temple plundering and cultural humiliation. The text functions as both a ritual lament and a political-theological meditation on foreign domination, religious desecration, and cosmic disorder.",

    "Short Description": "A retrospective evaluation of pharaohs from the Saite through Persian dynasties. Framed as a divine revelation from the god Thoth, the text judges each ruler by their adherence to Ma’at — the sacred principle of justice and order. It condemns Persians, for temple desecration and injustice, while praising native kings who supported the priesthood and the gods. The work culminates in a prophetic vision of a future Egyptian king who will arise from the South and restore divine order.",
