    "Short Description": "The Zoroastrian ritual texts from this period — primarily the Yasna, Visperad, and early Vendīdād — form the liturgical and cosmological backbone of early imperial Zoroastrianism. Transmitted orally by a priestly elite, these texts articulate a dualistic worldview centered on the eternal struggle between Asha (Truth, Order) and Druj (Lie, Chaos), anchored in meticulous ritual practice. The Yasna includes sacred chants and the preparation of Haoma, while the Vendīdād codifies laws of purity, penance, and mythic geography. The texts served both spiritual and political functions, reinforcing moral order, imperial legitimacy, and ritual taxonomy, while embedding the human soul within a vast, structured, and ethically charged cosmos.",

    "Short Description": "The texts is a result of priestly efforts to preserve and stabilize fragments of the Avesta in written form under Seleucid and early Parthian rule. These fragments include hymns from the Yasna, Visperad, and early Vendīdād. They codify purity laws, sacrificial rites, and cosmological affirmations of Asha (Truth, Order) against Druj (Lie, Chaos). Functioning both as liturgy and doctrinal regulation, the redactions reinforced priestly authority, upheld ritual timing, and maintained cultural continuity despite foreign domination. Though fragmentary, they form the theological backbone that later generated the Zand commentaries.",

    "Short Description": "A priestly corpus produced in Seleucid and early Parthian Iran, blending Babylonian astronomy with Zoroastrian cosmology. Structured as lists, tables, and interpretive passages, they recorded planetary cycles, intercalary months, and seasonal rites, while embedding these observations in the dualism of Asha (Truth, Order) versus Druj (Lie, Chaos). The texts regulated ritual timing, agricultural festivals, and royal ceremonies, functioning both as metaphysical treatises and administrative manuals. By aligning cosmic cycles with political authority and communal worship, they reinforced priestly control, imperial legitimacy, and the integration of human society into the eternal order of the heavens.",

    "Short Description": "A collection of formulaic proclamations carved on stone or metal, typically limited to a few lines. They proclaimed dynastic legitimacy, divine sanction, and military prowess. Almost always invoking Ahura Mazda or other deities, they presented the king as “King of Kings”, conqueror, and just ruler. Despite their brevity, these inscriptions were deliberately spread across different sites in Mesopotamia, Iran, and surrounding regions, ensuring visibility among diverse populations. Their primary function was political legitimation: to project Arsacid authority and continuity in the wake of Seleucid decline. While lacking narrative depth, their ubiquity and formulaic style reinforced the dynasty’s claim to universal kingship and divine approval, embedding them into landscape of the empire.",

Structured as a layered text — Avestan scripture, Middle Persian gloss, and interpretive commentary — they explain ritual procedures, ethical injunctions, and cosmological principles. The Zand clarified the difficult sacred language of the Avesta for priestly training, systematized purity laws and ritual practices, and reinforced the dualistic worldview of Asha (truth, order) versus Druj (lie, chaos). Functioning simultaneously as theological guide, moral code, and cultural defense, these commentaries preserved Iranian religious identity within a Hellenistic political landscape.",
