    "Short Description":"A brief but significant Carthaginian exploration report recounting a naval expedition along the West African coast, launched by the Carthaginian admiral Hanno. The purpose of the voyage was colonial and religious: to establish new settlements, reinforce Punic presence along the Atlantic, and found temples in honor of the gods. The expedition reportedly sailed beyond the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar), founding multiple colonies—such as Thymiaterion and Cerne. The original text was written in Punic and inscribed in the temple of Baal Hammon in Carthage. However, the work survives only in a Greek translation, probably created in the Hellenistic or early Roman period. The surviving Greek version may have been shortened or altered, possibly reflecting both translation issues and selective transmission.",

These inscriptions record vows or offerings made by individuals to deities such as Baal, Astarte, or Melqart. The formulaic texts often follow a structure like: “To [Deity], [Name] son of [Name], has vowed\/offered [object] for he heard his voice.” They served as ritual markers of devotion, fulfillment of vows, or gratitude for divine favor, and sometimes included curses against those who might tamper with the inscription.",

These inscriptions accompany urns containing the cremated remains of sacrificial offerings—sometimes animals, but mostly children—and reflect a ritual system involving sacrifice, divine reciprocity, and priestly authority. Though formulaic, they offer deep insights into the religious structure, symbolic order, and moral cosmology of the Punic world.",

The curses often contained formulaic invocations, names of targets, and specific punishments requested. In many cases, the tablets were placed in tophets or other sanctified precincts closely associated with sacrificial rites, including animal and child sacrifice. These offerings may have accompanied or empowered the curses, binding the request to divine justice through blood or fire.",
