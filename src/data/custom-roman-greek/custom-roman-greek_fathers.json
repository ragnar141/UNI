    "Description":"Posidonius of Apamea was a Stoic philosopher, scientist, and statesman who lived and taught in Rhodes. A universal scholar, he wrote on philosophy, astronomy, history, and geography, linking tides to the Moon and attempting to measure Earth’s size. He traveled widely, studying Celts and Iberians, and became a teacher to Roman elites like Cicero and Pompey. Though his works survive only in fragments, Posidonius was remembered as the “sage of Rhodes,” a symbol of Stoic cosmology and the archetype of the philosopher as scientist, explorer, and civic leader.",
