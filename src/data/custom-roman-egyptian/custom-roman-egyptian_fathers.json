    "Description": "Hypatia of Alexandria was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who rose to international fame as a teacher and public intellectual. Renowned for her sharp intellect and celibate life, she became both a trusted adviser and a lightning rod in a city torn by religious strife. Her violent death at the hands of a Christian mob transformed her into a martyr of philosophy and science, and over centuries she was mythologized into a symbol of rationality, tolerance, and the tragic clash between ancient learning and rising Christian dogma.",
