More a visionary than a warrior, he spent years in Tema pursuing religious projects, a period of aloofness that left him blind to the rapid rise of Cyrus of Persia. His neglect of Marduk\u2019s cult estranged Babylon\u2019s priesthood, while the city\u2019s elites, already disaffected, were subtly courted and seduced by Cyrus before his official arrival. Though he styled himself as a restorer of divine order and the first \u201carchaeologist-king,\u201d his eccentric priorities smoothed the way for Babylon\u2019s fall."
