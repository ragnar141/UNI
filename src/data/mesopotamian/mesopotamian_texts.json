    "Short Description": "A multi-tablet Babylonian incantation and ritual text used in purification and exorcism ceremonies. Its central purpose is to rid a person of unknown sins or curses—especially those committed unknowingly—which were believed to cause illness, misfortune, or divine punishment. The text includes a systematic invocation of various gods, detailed confessions, and ritual instructions involving fire, water, and offerings. The name Šurpu means “burning,” and the ritual often culminates in symbolic destruction—such as the burning of effigies or cursed objects—to signify purification.",

Cyrus claims to have peacefully entered Babylon, restored temples, returned displaced peoples and sacred images, and reestablished local cults. It represents one of the earliest articulations of just, tolerant, and theologically-sanctioned empire, blending Babylonian symbolic structures with emerging Persian imperial ideology.",

He justifies his ten-year absence from Babylon as a divine mission and asserts his legitimacy and piety, despite breaking with Babylonian religious orthodoxy by elevating Sin over Marduk. The inscriptions reflect a fusion of personal mysticism, royal propaganda, and theological reordering.",
