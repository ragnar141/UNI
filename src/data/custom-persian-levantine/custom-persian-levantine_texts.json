    "Short Description": "A series of short dedicatory texts, mostly engraved on stone stelae, written in Phoenician and found at the ancient site of Kition. These inscriptions record vows or offerings made by individuals to deities such as Baal, Astarte, or Melqart. The formulaic texts often follow a structure like: “To [Deity], [Name] son of [Name], has vowed/offered [object] for he heard his voice.” They served as ritual markers of devotion, fulfillment of vows, or gratitude for divine favor, and sometimes included curses against those who might tamper with the inscription.",

It reflects royal ideology, divine favor, and ceremonial protocols surrounding death and burial in Phoenician religious-political culture.",
