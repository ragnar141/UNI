    "Description":"Malachi was a prophet whose name means “my messenger.” He addressed the community of Judah after the Temple was rebuilt but when religious zeal had grown cold. He condemned corrupt priests, insincere sacrifices, and faithlessness in marriage, urging the people to honor God with integrity in both worship and daily life. His short book looks forward to a coming “day of the Lord” and the appearance of a messenger who would prepare the way. From a broad monotheistic perspective, Malachi stands as a final prophetic voice linking devotion to ethical responsibility and pointing toward renewal beyond his own age.",
