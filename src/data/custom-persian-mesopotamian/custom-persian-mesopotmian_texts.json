    "Short Description":"A poetic and polemical text composed in Akkadian to condemn the last Neo-Babylonian king, Nabonidus. Written from a priestly perspective, the text accuses him of impiety, self-deification, and neglect of Marduk’s cult, portraying his rule as a disruption of cosmic and ritual order. It frames Nabonidus’s withdrawal from Babylon and his religious innovations as causes for divine abandonment, culminating in his political downfall. The text justifies the rise of Cyrus the Great as a divinely sanctioned correction.",

    "Short Description":"A text that recounts a legendary list of past kings and their treatment of the Babylonian cult center of Esagil (temple of Marduk). It presents a moral-political theology: those kings who honored Marduk and Esagil prospered, while those who neglected or disrespected it met ruin. It retroactively constructs a theological justification for Babylon’s centrality and religious supremacy. The narrative functions as a mirror and warning to later rulers, urging them to uphold piety and ritual correctness as conditions for legitimate rule.",
