    "Description": "Apollonius of Tyana was a Greek philosopher and ascetic from Cappadocia who lived by the strict Pythagorean discipline of silence, celibacy, and vegetarianism. He traveled widely — to India, Egypt, and Rome — gaining fame as a wandering sage, healer, and moral reformer. Ancient sources credit him with miracles like curing plagues and raising the dead, which later made him a pagan counterpart to Jesus in Christian debates. He was tried under Emperor Domitian but reputedly vanished from court, further feeding his legend. His life, preserved by Philostratus in the 3rd century, blends a historical philosopher with the mythical image of a wonder-working holy man respected across the Roman world.",
