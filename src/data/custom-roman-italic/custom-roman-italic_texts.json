Two plaques are written in Etruscan, and one in Phoenician, making them a rare bilingual ritual inscription. The text commemorates the construction of a temple and affirms that Astarte granted the king his rule. The text reflects strong Phoenician religious influence and symbolic diplomacy, yet it is embedded within an Etruscan political framework.",

At a later date—likely during the Roman or Ptolemaic period—the linen was repurposed in Egypt as the wrapping for a female mummy, reflecting ancient practices of material reuse and cross-cultural convergence. In the 19th century, the mummy was acquired by a Croatian official and brought to Zagreb, where the linen wrappings were eventually recognized as a unique and invaluable Etruscan liturgical text.",

They were performed at state-sponsored public festivals (ludi), making them accessible to the entire population. Popular themes included clever slaves outwitting their masters, young lovers overcoming obstacles, misers and braggart soldiers ridiculed, and trickery or mistaken identity leading to comic reversals. Through these comedies, Plautus embedded Greek dramatic tradition into the Roman symbolic system, creating some of the earliest examples of broadly shared Roman theater.",

Compared to Plautus’ slapstick and populist humor, Terence’s plays emphasized elegant Latin, moral reflection, and psychological depth, often exploring family conflict, education, and ethical responsibility. Performed at state-sponsored festivals, they were less wildly popular with the masses but became central to the literate tradition, studied for centuries as models of pure Latin and higher-scale Roman theater.",

These inscriptions commemorate illustrious members of local elite families who served in Roman political, religious, and military roles. Each elogium briefly narrates the public deeds and virtues of the deceased, serving both as memorialization and as civic exempla. The structure of each elogium typically follows a formulaic pattern: name, lineage, public offices held, military achievements, and sometimes honors received—designed to glorify virtus (virtue) and dignitas (dignity). Symbolically, the Elogia reflect an attempt by Tarquinian elites to preserve their ancestral prestige and assert their Roman identity while also upholding older Etruscan traditions of public commemoration.",

    "Short Description": "A collection of 116 poems blends short personal lyrics, longer mythological narratives, and biting epigrams. Catullus’ poetry circulated primarily among the literate Roman elite, though its wit and invective gave it a wider social echo. Drawing heavily on Greek models (Sappho, Callimachus), the poems adapt Hellenistic refinement into a raw, personal Roman idiom. The themes range from intense erotic passion (his love for Lesbia), through satirical invective against political figures like Caesar and Mamurra, to existential reflection on love, mortality, and betrayal. In form, the collection spans hendecasyllabic lyrics, elegiac couplets, and an extended epyllion (Poem 64 on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis). Catullus presents himself as a poet of extremes — passionate, obscene, tender and tragic.",

    "Short Description": "A philosophical dialogue, modeled on Plato’s Republic but grounded in Roman political realities. Through conversations among prominent Roman statesmen—chiefly Scipio Aemilianus—the dialogue explores the ideal form of government, justice, law, and civic duty. Cicero argues for a mixed constitution combining monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, which he sees exemplified in the Roman Republic. The work defends Roman traditions while applying Stoic and Platonic thought to political life. Its most famous surviving section, the Somnium Scipionis (Dream of Scipio), presents a metaphysical vision of the cosmos and the soul's immortality, linking virtue in public service with cosmic harmony.",

Is virtue enough for happiness? Drawing from Stoicism, Platonism, and Academic Skepticism, Cicero argues that virtue is sufficient for a happy life, and that reason can free the soul from fear, suffering, and emotional disturbance. The work offers a Stoic therapy of the soul for a Roman world in moral and political crisis.",

The work lays out a structured code of civic virtue, justice, and personal responsibility, promoting duty to others, to the state, and to reason as the highest human calling.

Old age, he argues, offers freedom from passion, the opportunity for contemplation, and the dignity of a life well-lived.",

The text serves a dual purpose: it legitimizes the Republic’s defense under Cicero, while also offering a critique of Rome’s corruption and ambition, which produced figures like Catiline. Written in Sallust’s terse, archaizing Latin, it was aimed at the literate Roman elite, not the masses.",

Jugurtha, adopted into the royal family, usurped power by murdering rivals and bribing Roman officials to secure his position. His cunning exposed the corruption of Rome’s ruling elite, as senators repeatedly took bribes instead of enforcing justice. Sallust traces the war from Jugurtha’s initial intrigues and assassinations through years of guerrilla resistance against Roman armies. Jugurtha proved a master of deception, exploiting terrain and bribery to evade capture. The narrative highlights Rome’s failures under corrupt or incompetent commanders, until the rise of Gaius Marius, who reformed the army and restored discipline. Under Marius and his quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Rome finally defeated Jugurtha. Jugurtha was betrayed by his ally Bocchus of Mauretania, handed over to the Romans, and paraded in chains at Marius’ triumph in 104 BCE.",

Drawing from Greek, Egyptian, Near Eastern, and Roman sources, it begins with cosmogony and early myths (Books 1–6), follows through the Trojan War, archaic and classical Greece, and continues into Roman conquests (Books 7–40). Diodorus presents history as a source of moral instruction, emphasizing the deeds of great men and the unfolding of divine justice. His work is eclectic, moralizing, and synthetic—positioned as an encyclopedic repository of the known world’s political and cultural memory.",

In a Roman culture that prized martial valor, political service, and ambition, Tibullus’ submission to passion and rejection of imperial values form a subversive stance, elevating private love above conquest and civic duty.",

Its structure shifts between witty seduction, jealous complaint, and ironic self-mockery, often parodying the conventions of epic and elegy alike. The poems flaunt a subversive curiosity toward eroticism outside marriage, presenting adultery, clandestine affairs, and the “art of love” not as moral failings but as occasions for pleasure and literary display. In a Roman culture that officially prized marital fidelity and civic duty, Ovid’s celebration of erotic play, infidelity, and seduction inverted social norms, positioning poetry as a private counter-realm of freedom against the moralizing ideology of Augustus’ regime.",

The second half (Books 7–12) shifts to The Iliad's martial tone, chronicling Aeneas’s battles against local Italian tribes as he seeks to secure his destined homeland. Beneath the surface, the Aeneid serves a powerful propagandistic function: it glorifies Rome’s imperial destiny and legitimizes the reign of Augustus by framing it as the fulfillment of divine will. The poem masterfully amalgamates genres—epic, prophecy, tragedy, romance, history, and political myth—into a symbolic founding narrative of Rome, blending mythic theology, moral philosophy, and imperial ideology.",

In Roman culture, where masculine ideals were tied to war, politics, and public duty, this poetic sulking over a woman was a deeply subversive gesture — an inversion of dominant values that elevated private eros above empire. In his later books, Propertius expands beyond personal desire to engage with Roman myth, history, and Augustus’ political order, creating an unresolved tension between private devotion and public ideology.",

Books I and II instruct men on how to find, win, and keep lovers, while Book III offers advice to women on attracting and sustaining desire. Blending witty aphorisms, mythological examples, and urban observation, Ovid turns love into a craft to be mastered — an “art” equal to war, politics, or rhetoric. Its subversive humor lies in treating adultery and erotic intrigue as games of skill, directly undermining Augustus’ moral legislation that sought to regulate sexuality and marriage. At once a parody of serious didactic treatises and a polished aesthetic performance, the poem elevates seduction into literature, positioning Ovid as both master and trickster of eros. This very boldness, however, proved dangerous: Augustus exiled Ovid in 8 CE, and the Ars Amatoria — “a poem and a mistake” — was almost certainly central to his downfall, leaving him to spend the last decade of his life far from Rome on the Black Sea.",

    "Short Description": "A fifteen-book epic tracing the theme of transformation from the creation of the world to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar and the rise of Augustus. Drawing together a vast mosaic of Greek myths, heroic legends, and divine intrigues, Ovid fuses them with Roman tales and political destiny. The poem unfolds as a continuous narrative in which metamorphosis becomes both a poetic device and a way of linking past to present, myth to history, Greece to Rome. Though not commissioned by the state, it mirrors Augustan cultural currents by closing with Rome’s imperial triumph, casting Augustus as the inheritor of a universal mythic order. Yet Ovid’s tone often tempers celebration with irony and wit, resisting the straightforward propaganda of Virgil’s Aeneid. In this way, the Metamorphoses both situates Rome within a grand cosmic narrative and subtly questions the very process of mytho-political legitimation.",

    "Short Description": "A poetic calendar in elegiac couplets, originally planned for twelve books but surviving in six (January–June). Each book traces the Roman festival cycle of its month, weaving together mythological aetiologies, astronomical notes, and antiquarian lore with Ovid’s characteristic wit. On the surface, the poem supports Augustus’ religious revival, embedding the Julian dynasty into Rome’s sacred year; yet its playful digressions, comic retellings, and erotic insertions subtly undercut the solemnity of state propaganda. Drawing on the Hellenistic aetiological tradition while rooting itself in Roman ritual and history, the Fasti becomes at once a cultural memory project, a liturgical chronicle, and a subversive reimagining of Rome’s ritual time.",

Drawing on Stoic logic, he outlines how to prevent anger through self-awareness, habit, and reason, offering strategies for educating children and rulers alike. The work functions as both ethical reflection and political guidance, advocating restraint and rational self-mastery as marks of the wise and just person.",

Instead of becoming a god, he is “pumpkinified” (a play on the word for deification), and sent down to the underworld, where he is condemned to eternal punishment—endlessly hearing lawsuits, a jab at his judicial obsessions. Through biting humor and mythic parody, the work ridicules imperial flattery, exposes the absurdity of emperor-worship, and critiques Claudius’ legacy.",

    "Short Description": "An autobiographical and apologetic work framed as a personal defense against accusations made by Justus of Tiberias. The text recounts the author’s priestly lineage, Pharisaic background, education, and involvement in the Jewish revolt, particularly his governorship in Galilee. Josephus, a priest, Pharisee, and general during the war, later became a court historian under the Flavian emperors. The work emphasizes his moderation, rationality, and loyalty to both Jewish law and the Roman Empire, portraying his survival and imperial service as part of a divine plan. Throughout, the text reflects the remarkable adaptability of Josephus as a Pharisaic intellectual navigating multiple cultural and political worlds.",

The text honors Agricola’s character and military campaigns, especially his decisive victory at Mons Graupius, while also describing Britain’s land, people, and Romanization. Beyond biography, Tacitus uses the work as a veiled critique of Emperor Domitian’s tyranny, contrasting the corruption of imperial rule with Agricola’s modesty, discipline, and virtue. It is both a historical record of conquest and an ethical lesson in how to live honorably under oppression.",

While mime flourished as a form of subversive entertainment with stock characters and social parody, pantomime evolved into a highly aestheticized performance genre that conveyed emotional mythic stories through gesture and movement. Many of these performances, especially pantomimes, were state-commissioned under Roman emperors such as Augustus and Nero, who used them as tools of imperial spectacle and cultural messaging.",

Frontinus wrote it partly as a supplement to his lost theoretical work On Military Science. His purpose was didactic and practical: to provide future commanders with ready examples of ingenuity, while also upholding Roman values by condemning tricks that blurred into treachery. Blending history, instruction, and political reflection, the work emphasizes Roman adaptability and resourcefulness as keys to imperial success. It is both a catalogue of military wit and a celebration of Rome’s martial heritage.",

Book II offers a powerful defense of Mosaic law as a divinely revealed and philosophically rational system, morally superior to pagan traditions. The work operates at the crossroads of Yahwistic theology, Hellenic rhetorical philosophy, and Roman political legitimacy. Through this synthesis, Josephus constructs a metaphysical and civic justification for Jewish tradition within a hostile imperial context.",

Tacitus combines rigorous chronology with sharp moral analysis, portraying the destructive force of ambition and the fragility of political legitimacy. Beneath its historical surface, the text serves as a meditation on power, corruption, and fate — showing how Rome’s own strength turned inward to consume itself before consolidating under Vespasian.",

Juvenal’s aim is both to expose vice and warn against misplaced desires, culminating in the famous maxim: “Mens sana in corpore sano” (“a healthy mind in a healthy body”). While deeply rooted in its time, the Satires transcend their context by dramatizing enduring themes: the dangers of power, the illusions of wealth and fame, and the corruption of human motives.",

Written originally during winter nights in Attica, it gathers anecdotes, quotations, and reflections on philosophy, Roman law, grammar, rhetoric, literature, and antiquarian lore. The work has no single argument but serves as a cultural notebook: a record of Roman and Greek learning preserved for memory, teaching, and intellectual delight. Gellius cites philosophers like Favorinus, poets like Virgil and Ennius, and jurists of the Roman tradition, offering both linguistic curiosities and moral reflections. It is both didactic and antiquarian: a private record that became a public resource for the Roman educated elite.",

The text reflects a ruler’s effort to maintain self-mastery, justice, and dignity in a world unraveling around him.

The treatise is both scientific and philosophical, aiming to establish the teleological basis for bodily functions (i.e., that nature acts for a purpose). “Every one of the parts of the animal body is for the sake of some function… no part is without reason.”",

    "Short Description": "An allegorical commentary on a brief passage from Homer’s Odyssey (Book 13) describing a cave on Ithaca inhabited by nymphs. Porphyry interprets the cave and its features—the nymphs, their weaving, the two gates—as symbols of the cosmos and the soul’s journey. The northern gate represents the descent of souls into the material world, and the southern gate their ascent to the divine. Blending Homeric myth with Platonic metaphysics, the work teaches a mystical-philosophical view of the soul’s embodiment and liberation.",

It defines and explains the five “predicables” — genus, species, difference, property, and accident — which are the basic ways in which terms can relate to things. Porphyry famously avoids tackling the deeper metaphysical question of whether these categories exist in reality or only in the mind, focusing instead on their use as conceptual tools. The work became a cornerstone of logical education in late antiquity, the medieval Islamic world, and medieval Europe through Boethius’ Latin translation.",

The text itself has not survived; it is known only through quotations and paraphrases preserved in the works of Christian apologists such as Macarius Magnes, Augustine, Jerome, and others who wrote to refute it.",

The work outlines the soul’s divine origin, its descent into the material realm according to cosmic law, and the path of return through moral purification and philosophical contemplation. Porphyry describes four stages of virtue—political, purgative, contemplative, and paradigmatic—as the progressive means by which the soul detaches from mortal concerns and reorients itself toward its divine source. The return is not a physical journey but an inward conversion of thought, culminating in union with the One.",

    "Short Description": "The text is framed as a series of pointed questions from a philosopher to an Egyptian priest named Anebo, challenging the rationale and consistency of Egyptian religious practices. The letter asks why priests rely on rituals, sacrifices, invocations, and material symbols if the divine is incorporeal and beyond human compulsion. It probes the nature of daemons, gods, fate, divination, and theurgy, pressing for philosophical justification rather than traditional authority. The tone is interrogative and critical, setting the stage for Iamblichus’ later On the Mysteries, which responds to these very objections. In essence, the text is a structured philosophical inquiry into the meaning and metaphysics of ritual, testing the compatibility of Egyptian ceremonial religion with Neoplatonic philosophy.",

While borrowing the Roman categories of virtue—justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance—Ambrose redefines them through the lens of Scripture and Christ’s example, making humility, mercy, and charity the central clerical virtues. The work serves as both a manual of moral formation for priests and bishops and as a public statement of the Church’s moral authority, elevating Christian duty above traditional Roman civic ideals. By doing so, Ambrose shaped the ethical expectations of the clergy and advanced the Church’s claim to guide society’s values and order, at a moment when Christianity was becoming the dominant cultural force of the late Roman Empire.",
